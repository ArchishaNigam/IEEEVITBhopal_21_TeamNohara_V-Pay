Project Description - 
The main motive behind building this application was to cater to a large sect of students who regularly face issues in undergoing transactions within the college premises such as connectivity issues or transaction failures due to discrepancies in the online system. The app's main purpose is to enable a credit/debit system specifically for within-campus transactions (Ex. Mayuri, UB, VisaMart, laundry, etc.). Another added feature will be a dedicated interface for event registrations within the campus to simplify the overall registration process and give the students a comprehensive view of the planned events to encourage extra-curricular participation.

Theme Fit - 
This fits the theme of student welfare because we are trying to simplify the payment procedure for students, making it convenient for them to manage their expenses and have a designated place to monitor their spending habits within the college. Since we are planning to follow a pre-paid model for the app, another added benefit will be that students will be able to budget their expenses in a better way and curtail unnecessary spending.

Future Enhancements - 
Initially developed as a financial tracking app, this app has a lot of scope for broad perspective due to the large number of prospective users. The future possible enhancements are:-
1) A centralized complaint/suggestions forum for the students and faculty to smooth the entire process and ensure better problem-solving.
2) a separate networking forum for students
   this is a feature needed when students do not like to hand out personal details(such as phone numbers or Instagram handles). apart from personal communication we also 
   plan on having chatrooms for different batches/branches or base them on personal interests(such as sports, reading, gardening, etc.)
3) Access to a database of students along with their branches and batches to facilitate easier communication.
4) Frequent updates shall be rolled out wit more features as per the needs of students
